DIJKSTRA ALGORITHM - to find the shortest path in a graph

Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph. 

When We find shortest distance from a start to destination in Map.
On your phone, this graph would look like a map, but under the hood, it is a data structure called a weighted graph. The locations on the map are the nodes of the graph, the paths between them are the edges, and the time to get from any one node to the other is the weight of each edge.
